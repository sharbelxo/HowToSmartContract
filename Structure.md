# Structure

The first thing we want to do, is to create a directory or folder, where our code and files will be placed.  

You can do that, simply, by creating a new folder on your Desktop or anywhere you want. For the sake of this tutorial, we will be creating the folder on our Desktop. 

## Tip:  
Instead of creating a new folder manually like this:  
insert pic
You can create a folder using your Command Prompt.  
First, you move to your Desktop by running:
```
cd Desktop
```
After that, you run:
```
mkdir FOLDER_NAME
```
Of course, instead of FOLDER_NAME, write the name of the folder you want to create.  
##

Lets say you named it MyFirstSmartContract.  

On the same Command Prompt window, we will move into the folder by running:  
```
cd MyFirstSmartContract
```
