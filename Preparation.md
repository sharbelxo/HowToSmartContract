## Preparations & Installations
Before we start this step by step tutorial, you need to make sure you install Node.js and Git.  

Please make sure you have installed the LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js:

We do not recommend installing the Current release as this often will include bugs or breaking changes that many libraries may not have fully resolved. When you install Node.js it will automatically install npm which is a CLI tool that we will use frequently throughout this tutorial.
