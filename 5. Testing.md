# Testing The Smart Contract

Testing the Smart Contract is basically testing the functions of the Solidity Smart Contract by giving it random values and calling them using the Mocha module we imported and JavaScript.  

First, we have to create a folder in the main directory/folder (MyFirstSmartContract). The folder will be called ```test``` and inside of it, create a file and call it ```Name.test.js```.  

AS we were doing before, we are going to copy and paste the following code into the file and then learn what each line of code means and does:  

```
const assert = require('assert');
const ganache = require('ganache-cli');
const Web3 = require('web3');
const web3 = new Web3(ganache.provider());

// evm: bytecode
const { abi, evm } = require('../compile');
```  

As you can see, we are going to use the ABI and the Bytecode(EVM) we got from the Contract compilation we did in the ```compile.js``` file. Also,
