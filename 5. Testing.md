# Testing The Smart Contract

Testing the Smart Contract is basically testing the functions of the Solidity Smart Contract by giving it random values and calling them using the Mocha module we imported and JavaScript.  

First, we have to create a folder in the main directory/folder (MyFirstSmartContract). The folder will be called ```test``` and inside of it, create a file and call it ```Name.test.js```.
