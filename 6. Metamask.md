# MetaMask  

MetaMask is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications.  

## Important

If you already have a MetaMask account, make sure you have test eth in your first account. If you don't have eth in your first account, check this part of the tutorial where we request test eth. Also, make sure you haev your MetaMask 12-word mnemonic written down/saved because we will use it in the deployment part of our tutorial.  

##

If you do not have MetaMask, you have to download its extension and have it pinned on your browser (Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc...). Follow along as we will download the MetaMask extension and get our MetaMask account ready to go!  

First, go to the Google Chrome extension store:  

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions

Here, search for MetaMask:

After that, move along and create a password and make sure you memorize it or write it down because you will use it everytime you want to access MetaMask. Keep going until you reach this screen:

Click on the blurry picture to reveal your secret recovery phrase or mnemonic. Make sure you download it using the link I marked in the picture above. Now a note file containing this secret phrase is in your Downloads folder on your computer. Note that you will have a different phrase than mine.  

Once you're in, you will notice that you are on the Ethereum Mainnet. We do not want that beacuse we will deploy our Smart Contract on a test network such as Rinkeby Network where we use test Ethereum for our deployemnt and transactions and NOT real money (real Ethereum).

As you can see in the picture above, the Rinkeby Network is not visible. Follow these steps to enable the test networks:

Go to the settings like this:

Now, we can see that we have no funds in our account. Follow the steps below to request test eth for our account:  

Testnet ETH is available from: https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby  
Backup Testnet ETH Faucets: https://rinkeby-faucet.com/, https://app.mycrypto.com/faucet  

Click the first link and you will see this screen:

You can get the address of your account like this:

copy it by clicking on it then paste it on the faucet website. Then, choose 0.1 eth. Note that you can do this step multiple times to get more test eth. However, we will use less than 0.1 eth to deploy our contract. When you request, wait for the confirmation and go check your account balance:

This is pretty much it. Make sure you have your secret phase with you because we will use it to deploy our Smart Contract on the Rinkeby Ethereum Test Network.
