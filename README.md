# HowToSmartContract

In this repository, you will learn how to write, test, and deploy your very own Smart Contract on the Ethereum Blockchain.  

Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.  

A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participantâ€™s ledger. The decentralised database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).  

Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.  

This means if one block in one chain was changed, it would be immediately apparent it had been tampered with. If hackers wanted to corrupt a blockchain system, they would have to change every block in the chain, across all of the distributed versions of the chain.  

Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are constantly and continually growing as blocks are being added to the chain, which significantly adds to the security of the ledger.

Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. One main difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is that Ethereum has Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts are the logic layer that allows developers to run code using the programming language called Solidity.  

A "smart contract" is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. It's a collection of code (its functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on the Ethereum blockchain.  

Smart contracts are a type of Ethereum account. This means they have a balance and they can send transactions over the network. However they're not controlled by a user, instead they are deployed to the network and run as programmed. User accounts can then interact with a smart contract by submitting transactions that execute a function defined on the smart contract. Smart contracts can define rules, like a regular contract, and automatically enforce them via the code. Smart contracts cannot be deleted by default, and interactions with them are irreversible.  

To get things started, follow the tutorial step-by-step. Skipping any line of text or part of the tutorial might result in errors.  

First, we will start with the [preparations & installations](https://github.com/sharbelxo/HowToSmartContract/blob/488733921bfd65890240e158a7c3d7b23bbc9aaf/1.%20Preparation.md) where you will download and install all the tools needed for this tutorial. Next, you will learn the [structure](https://github.com/sharbelxo/HowToSmartContract/blob/488733921bfd65890240e158a7c3d7b23bbc9aaf/2.%20Structure.md) of the tutorial and what our project directory will look like. After that, you will write your first [Smart Contract](https://github.com/sharbelxo/HowToSmartContract/blob/488733921bfd65890240e158a7c3d7b23bbc9aaf/3.%20Smart%20Contract.md) and add it to the project folder. When you finish writing your Smart Contract, you will [compile](https://github.com/sharbelxo/HowToSmartContract/blob/488733921bfd65890240e158a7c3d7b23bbc9aaf/4.%20Compile.md) it and [test](https://github.com/sharbelxo/HowToSmartContract/blob/488733921bfd65890240e158a7c3d7b23bbc9aaf/5.%20Test.md) it. When you finish testing, you will create a [MetaMask](https://github.com/sharbelxo/HowToSmartContract/blob/488733921bfd65890240e158a7c3d7b23bbc9aaf/6.%20Metamask.md) account that you will need to [deploy](https://github.com/sharbelxo/HowToSmartContract/blob/5c4a423064ad9a7b0749dd9296b2042ce69c4c19/7.%20Deploy.md) your Smart Contract.  

Feel free to issue your concerns and problems you face while doing this tutorial. I will ake sure I answer all your questions and fix what is needed for this mini-course to stay up-to-date.
